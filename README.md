# 🌟 Student Dropout Prediction 🌟

Welcome to the **Student Dropout Prediction** project! This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of students dropping out based on various academic and personal factors. Our goal is to assist educational institutions in identifying at-risk students early and providing timely interventions to improve retention rates.

## 🌍 Overview
Student retention is a critical metric for educational institutions. By predicting dropout risks, institutions can:
- Identify struggling students early.
- Provide targeted support to improve academic outcomes.
- Enhance overall student success and institutional performance.

This project analyzes various factors such as **grades**, **attendance**, **study hours**, and **personal demographics** to predict dropout probabilities using machine learning algorithms.
